In JavaScript, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

  define a function once and call it multiple times in different parts of your program. Functions help to make code modular, easier to maintain, and more readable.


function myName(name){
  console.log(`i am  ${name}`);
}
myName("praveen");
