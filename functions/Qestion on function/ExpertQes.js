// 1) Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that calculates and logs the factorial of a number.
// 2) Write a function that returns a memoized version of a function (stores the result of a function call and reuses it when the same arguments are passed).
// 3) Write a function that implements a custom map() method for an array.
// 4) Write a function that accepts an object and deep clones it (handles nested objects).
// 5) Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.
// 6) Write a function that checks whether two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in any order).
// 7) Write a function that accepts a number and returns its binary representation as a string.
// 8) Write a function that accepts a number and returns whether itâ€™s a happy number (a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of   its   digits).
// 9) Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of all the elements in the array.
// 10) Write a function that accepts an array of strings and returns the longest string.
