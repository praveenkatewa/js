// 1. Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns the square of the number using an arrow function.

// 2. Write a simple function that accepts two numbers and returns their sum.

// 3. Write an anonymous function that returns the product of two numbers, and assign it to a variable. Call the function and display the result.

// 4. Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that logs the message "I am an IIFE!" to the console.

// 5. Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

// 6. Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.

// 7. Write a function that demonstrates the difference between block scope and function scope by declaring variables with let, var, and const inside a loop.

// 8. What will be the output of the following code and why?
// var a = 10;
// function test() {
//     console.log(a);
//     var a = 20;
// }
// test();

// 9. What is the result of accessing a variable declared inside a block scope (with let or const) outside of the block?

// 10. Write a function that demonstrates how lexical scoping works with nested functions.

// 11. Write a function that checks if a variable is in the global scope or function scope.

// 12. Explain what will be logged in the following code:
// function outer() {
//     let a = 10;
//     function inner() {
//         console.log(a);
//     }
//     inner();
// }
// outer();


// 13. What will be the output of the following code and why?
// if (true) {
//     var x = 5;
// }
// console.log(x);

// 14. What will be the output of the following code and why?
// if (true) {
//     let y = 10;
// }
// console.log(y);

// 15. Write a function that shows how you can reassign a variable declared with let, but not one declared with const.

// 16. Write a piece of code that uses const for an object and changes its properties, but prevents reassignment of the object itself.

// 17. Write a function that takes two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using arithmetic operators and returns the results as an object.

// 18. Demonstrate the difference between var, let, and const by creating variables inside a loop and logging them.

// 19. Write a function that takes two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using arithmetic operators and returns the results as an object.

// 20. Convert the following traditional function to an arrow function:
// function greet(name) {
//     return "Hello " + name;
// }
