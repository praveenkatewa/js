== checks for value equality with type coercion, whereas === checks for both value and type equality.

A closure is a function that remembers its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. const variables cannot be reassigned.

Event delegation is a technique of using a single event listener to manage all events of a particular type for multiple elements, taking advantage of event bubbling.

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Prototype inheritance is a method by which one object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.

Arrow functions are a shorthand for writing functions and do not have their own this context. They inherit this from the surrounding scope.

The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

async functions return a promise, and await pauses the function execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.

null is an assigned value that represents no value, while undefined means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try, catch, and finally blocks.

call and apply invoke a function with a given this context. call accepts arguments individually, while apply accepts them as an array. bind returns a new function with a specified this context and arguments.

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code execution.

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result.

this refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value depends on how the function is called.

Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, blocking the main thread, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.

Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for lazy evaluation and handling asynchronous operations with yield.

Destructuring is a syntax for unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

The spread operator (...) allows an iterable (like an array or object) to be expanded into individual elements.

Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one script and imported into another. ES6 introduced the import and export syntax for modules.

map creates a new array by applying a function to each element. filter creates a new array with elements that pass a test. reduce executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

typeof returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. instanceof tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Currying is a technique of evaluating functions with multiple arguments, by transforming them into a sequence of functions each with a single argument.

Template literals are enclosed by backticks (`), allowing embedded expressions and multiline strings, as well as string interpolation using ${expression}`.

Object.create() creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

Using Array.isArray(variable).

Memoization is an optimization technique where the results of expensive function calls are cached and returned when the same inputs occur again.

An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after its definition. It is used to avoid polluting the global scope.

Improved productivity, reusable components, easier management of state and DOM, efficient updates, and enhanced performance through virtual DOM (React) or two-way data binding (Angular).

The new keyword is used to create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

Synthetic events are React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. They ensure that events have consistent properties across different browsers.

super is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access parent class methods.

Object literals, constructor functions, Object.create(), and ES6 classes.

A shallow copy copies an object’s properties, while a deep copy copies all nested objects, ensuring complete duplication without references to the original objects.

The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It allows React to efficiently update and render components by diffing the virtual DOM and updating only the changed parts.

Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in ES6, used to create unique and immutable values primarily for object property keys.

Debouncing delays the execution of a function until a specified time has elapsed since the last call. Throttling limits the execution of a function to once every specified period.

Using event.stopPropagation() to stop the event from propagating up the DOM tree.

Proxies allow you to create a proxy object that intercepts and defines custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation).
